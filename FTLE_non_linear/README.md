# FTLEs from non-linear trajectories

This folder contains the code needed to calculate a non-linear trajectory and subsequently calculate FTLEs.

1. Run *ABCdynamo.py* to calculate a non-linear trajectory starting from the ABC flow and a small random magnetic field.
2. Then run *ABCdynamoPaths.py* to calculate the FTLEs starting from a snapshot saved from step 1.
3. *ABCdynamoPassive.py* allows a passive dynamo to be solved for on top of a non-linearly saturated MHD state obtained from step 1.
